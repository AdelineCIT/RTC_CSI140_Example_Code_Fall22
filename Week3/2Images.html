        The &lt;img&gt; tag is used to display an image. The src attribute contains
        a link to the image. The alt attribute explains what the image is a picture 
        of. The title sets text that displays when someone mouses over the image. There 
        is also a width and a height attribute that takes a size in pixels. These 
        are not frequently used since there are better alternatives in CSS.
